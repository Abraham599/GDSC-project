    Guardians of the Galaxy
    </div>
    Guardians has everything a Marvel movie should: an awesome soundtrack, a hilarious script, a unique visual style, its own attitude, an ensemble of fully-developed characters, a talking tree, and the rare ability to stand alone among the rest of the universe. Guardians is at once part of the MCU and literally its own galaxy, yet it still provides the backbone for how all these worlds are connected.

    Iron Man (2008)
    </div>
    It’s the movie that started it all. Iron Man changed not only the superhero genre, but the movie industry as a whole. Plus, this was the movie that brought Robert Downey Jr. back, and the only Iron Man movie in which Tony Stark is a lovable asshole rather than just an asshole.

    Thor: Ragnarok
    </div>
    After two very bad Thor movies, director Taika Waititi somehow managed to not only save the franchise, but provide a promising formula for the next generation of Marvel movies. Thor: Ragnarok is a hilarious, exciting, and unexpected outing that stands apart from every other film in the MCU.

    Avengers: Endgame
    </div>
    Though the stakes remain low in the Marvel Cinematic Universe—particularly low because of lazy plot devices—Endgame does its best to create emotional conclusions for some of the most iconic heroes of the last decade. It might be much of what fans expected from this movie, but it brilliantly wraps up 10 years of movies and takes the time to actually focus on its characters.

    Captain America: The Winter Soldier
    </div>
    Even though it falls into the familiar Marvel trap of a big, stupid ending, about two-thirds of Winter Soldier is a riskier and smarter entry into the MCU than most.

    Spider-Man: Homecoming
    </div>
    In a refreshing change of pace, Marvel turns a Spider-Man movie into a funny teen drama that gives the supporting characters a chance to feel alive. The biggest accomplishment here, though, is making the sixth Spider-Man movie (with the third actor to play Peter Parker) in 15 years somehow one of the character's greatest big-screen outings.

    Spider-Man: No Way Home
    </div>
    Even though, at times, leading up to its release, Spider-Man: No Way Home felt like it wouldn't match its own hype, director Jon Watts and Tom Holland, with all of the grace and heart of Peter Parker himself, managed to pull it off. No Way Home is a celebration of Spider-Man, even if the MCU of it all slightly muddles the character's coming-of-age story. We'll remember the feelings we had when we watched No Way Home for a long, long time.
